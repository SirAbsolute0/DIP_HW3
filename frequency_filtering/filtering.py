        You can perform post processing as needed. For example,
        1. You can perfrom log compression
        2. You can perfrom a full contrast stretch (fsimage)
        3. You can take negative (255 - fsimage)
        4. etc.

        You are allowed to use inbuilt functions to compute fft
        There are packages available in numpy as well as in opencv
        Steps:
        1. Compute the fft of the image
        2. shift the fft to center the low frequencies
        3. get the mask (write your code in functions provided above) the functions can be called by self.filter(shape)
        4. filter the image frequency based on the mask (Convolution theorem)
        5. compute the inverse shift
        6. compute the inverse fourier transform
        7. compute the magnitude
        8. You will need to do post processing on the magnitude and depending on the algorithm (use post_process_image to write this code)
        Note: You do not have to do zero padding as discussed in class, the inbuilt functions takes care of that
        filtered image, magnitude of frequency_filtering, magnitude of filtered frequency_filtering: Make sure all images being returned have grey scale full contrast stretch and dtype=uint8
